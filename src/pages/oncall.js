        <p>"Olympic On Call" is a service being offered for the current school year
            (2017-2018). Morning and afternoon pick ups are being offered on an ala-carte
            basis for central location stops. If your student is in need of a ride, phone Olympic
            to see if we have a seat available. If a seat is available, fill out a Minor Liability Waiver.
            This Waiver must be received prior to the student riding on Olympic. Once the Waiver
            is received, your driver will be notified to pick up your student and transport them
            to or from school. This service is offered on a daily basis for any student attending
            Bradford Preparatory School, Corvian Community School, Lake Norman Charter,
            Langtree Charter Academy, or Pine Lake Preparatory. This is a great opportunity for
            those families who need a ride to school just once-in-a-while or as a last minute
            need. The fee for the service is $10.00 each way. Sibling discounts do not apply
            to this offer.</p>
