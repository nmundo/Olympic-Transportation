            Q: How are your routes determined?
            A: For our parent-paid service, our routes and stops are determined by parent need. We examine the areas where the need is the greatest and develop routes that are no longer than 50-60 minutes.  e stops are based on central location pick up and drop o .
            Q: Why don’t you have pricing on your website?
            A: We do not provide pricing on our website, as each school is priced di erently. Each charter school has a di erent academic calendar and number of attendance days.
            Q: How do you train your drivers?
            A: Training our Drivers begins with the driver/route paperwork and pre-trip inspection methods.  e new Driver rides with a Trainer on their assigned route for at least two days, then drives the route for several days without passengers, and when route-ready, they are permitted to drive under supervision. Trainees with experience driving a school bus may exit the training program more quickly. Typically, we average 15-20 hours of training before we permit a driver to be on board with students. Once brought on board, every driver must attend quarterly driver safety meetings where topics such as bullying, student behavior management, adverse weather conditions, etc. are addressed.
            Q: Do you perform background checks on your driv- ers?
            A: Our hiring process includes a background check, as well as obtaining a motor vehicle driving record from the DMV and we request safety and drug testing information from all the applicants’ employers for the past three years.
            Q: What does the DOT number on the side of your vehicles indicate?
            A: Our DOT number can be used on the Federal Mo- tor Carrier Safety Administration website to checkout our safety record. Secondly, it indicates that we are subject to a yearly inspection by a DOT regulated inspector.  ird, the number is an indicator that our drivers are a part of a drug and alcohol testing pro- gram. Finally, it indicates that our drivers must ad- here to annual review and inspection of their driving records, as well as the obtainment of a federal medical examination certi cate.
            Q: How do you manage a school’s transportation  eet? A: Once we are asked to examine a school’s transpor- tation program, we make recommendations to best streamline the process already in place. We also make recommendations for additional driver training, ad- dition of equipment, route optimization, and safety measures.
            Q: Can a school contract out part or all of their busing to Olympic?
            A: Absolutely. As charter schools grow in number and in attendance, schools that attempt to provide busing can sometimes become overwhelmed with the intense amount of e ort and training that transportation can take. Olympic can bring their equipment and exper- tise to any charter school and provide a transportation solution as directed by the Board. Whether it’s one
            bus or 10, one route or 5, we can provide a turn-key or management solution for the bene t of the parents, the students and the school.
            Q: Do you do  eld trips or special outings?
            A: Yes, we provide  eld trips throughout the entire State of North Carolina. We will also provide transport for special outings such as scouting events, summer camps, and group transport.
            We succeed, when you succeed.
